<p>The Newsletter will publish original work by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scientists, wildlife biologists, park managers and other contributors on any aspect of tapir natural history including distribution, ecology, evolution, genetics, habitat, husbandry, management, policy and taxonomy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Preference is given to material that has the potential to improve
conservation management and enhances understanding of tapir conservation
in its respective range countries.</p>
<p>The primary languages of the Newsletter are English and Spanish.
